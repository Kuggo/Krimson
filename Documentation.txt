Krimson vm in urcl:
    4 registers used:
    SP as SP
    R1 as ACC
    R2 as B
    R3 as BP

    The ACC will always contain the top of the stack. it's the destination of all operations and the source of all the
    operations
    If an operation needs more than 1 operand, the B register will be used as well.
    BP is used as a means to better deal with local vars, and arguments on each function scope.
